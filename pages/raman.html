                        <h2>What choices do I have?</h2>
                        <p>Actually there is not much choice in this restaurant as this restaurant is so confident that you would surely love there shrimp raman. Thus, you almost can only find all kinds shrimp raman with different flavor of soup.<br> Additionally, some side dishes such as Gyoza or Onigiri could also be ordered but only with shrimp flavor too! ;p</p>

                    <h2>So How does it Taste?</h2>
                        <p>To be honest, the only feeling I have after tasting this bowl of raman is -- 'SO SHRIMP'!!<br>
                        This sounds like very useless opinion, but no kidding, the taste of shrimp is super strong. Thus whether this raman is delicious or not depends on how much you like the flavor of shrimp. Of course you can imagine this conclusion must come from the fact (without any boast) the retaurant is cooking the soup by a lot of shrimps.<br>
                        The red part on the top of the noodle is also some kind of spice which is produced from shrimp too. This spice increase the different level of taste texture and brings another aroma of shrimp to the noodle.<br>
                        All in all, this restaurant could be a good choice if you like seafood, especially shrimp. If not, then please find other restaurants suit you better.</p>
